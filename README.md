# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** study repository! This repo contains my C++ implementations and notes while learning and practicing core DSA concepts. It includes structured topic-wise folders, source code, explanations, and problems solved during the learning journey.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repository covers the following major topics:

### 1. 🔢 Basic Mathematics
- Prime numbers, GCD, LCM
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Modular arithmetic and fast exponentiation

### 2. 📊 Arrays
- One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays
- Prefix sums, sliding window, Kadane’s Algorithm
- Sorting techniques and binary search applications

### 3. 🔠 Strings
- Character arrays vs `std::string`
- Palindromes, anagrams
- String pattern matching basics

### 4. 🔁 Recursion & Backtracking
- Basic recursion patterns
- Factorial, Fibonacci, subset generation
- Solving problems using backtracking

### 5. 🔗 Linked Lists
- Singly and doubly linked lists
- Insertion, deletion, reversal
- Detecting cycles and solving problems like merge and intersection

### 6. 🥞 Stacks & Queues
- Stack using arrays and linked lists
- Infix to postfix, balanced brackets
- Queue and circular queue implementation
- Deque and applications

### 7. 🌳 Trees & Graphs (Intro)
- Binary Trees: traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
- Binary Search Tree basics
- Introduction to Graphs and representations (adjacency list/matrix)
- BFS and DFS basics

### 8. 🔁 Revision & Mock Problems
- Mixed-topic problem solving
- Timed mock tests for placement-style practice
- Optimization and edge-case handling
