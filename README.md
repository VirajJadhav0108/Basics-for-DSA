# Basics-for-DSA
Welcome to my coding practice repository! This is where Iâ€™m keeping track of everything Iâ€™m learning as I grow my programming skills.
## ðŸ“š Topics I've Learned So Far
### âœ… 1. Basic Maths
- Learned how to solve simple math problems using code
- Practiced number operations, factors, primes, and basic logic
- Started using loops and conditions to solve maths-related problems
### âœ… 2. Arrays
- Learned how to store and access multiple values in an array
- Did problems like finding maximum/minimum, reversing arrays, and basic sorting
- Practiced traversing arrays using loops and solving real coding questions
### âœ… 3. Strings
- Learned what strings are and how to use them in code
- Practiced common operations like reversing a string, checking for palindrome, and counting characters
- Got comfortable with string indexing and manipulation
- ### âœ… 4. Recursion
- Understood what recursion is and how it works (functions calling themselves)
- Solved problems like factorial, Fibonacci, and basic backtracking questions
- Learned how to think in a step-by-step recursive way
## ðŸ›  What's in this repository?
Youâ€™ll find my code files for each of the above topics, with practice problems Iâ€™ve tried solving.

## ðŸ§  What Iâ€™ve Gained
- Better problem-solving skills
- Confidence in writing basic programs
- Understanding of how to break down a problem into smaller parts

## ðŸš€ What's Next?
Iâ€™ll be moving on to:
- Linked lists, stacks and queues
- Trees and graphs(intro)
- Then finally revision and mock problems
